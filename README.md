# CodeKata
SafeAuto CodeKata
For this project I create a Driver class include DriverMile(), AverageSpeed(), AddTrip(); 
craete a Trip class include TripTime() and DiscardTrip(); 
create a ReadDataFile class include ReadData.
CodeKataData is a text file that I put the test data.

If I have more time I would add more test case for this project. Also for the CodeKataData.txt, I use my local address for the location, so maybe there would have some error when others open the file in program.

Here is the description for this project
Example input:
Driver Dan
Driver Alex
Driver Bob
Trip Dan 07:15 07:45 17.3
Trip Dan 06:12 06:32 21.8
Trip Alex 12:01 13:16 42.0
Expected output:
Alex: 42 miles @ 34 mph
Dan: 39 miles @ 47 mph
Bob: 0 miles
